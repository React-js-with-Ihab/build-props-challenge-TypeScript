# 📚 build-props-challenge-TypeScript

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a full **conversion** of the `first-challenge` project from **JavaScript** to **TypeScript** ✅.  
The goal was to practice building reusable and flexible components in React, while leveraging TypeScript's strong typing system to define props and ensure safer code.

In this challenge, I created multiple components (such as `Post`, `Button`, and `Header`) and connected them dynamically through props.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Practiced

- Passing **props** between React components.
- Dynamically passing **attributes** through props.
- Sending complete JSX elements as **children** via props.
- Using **TypeScript** to define prop types for better safety and readability.
- Building flexible and reusable components.
- Working with a React + Vite + TypeScript project structure.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `Header.tsx` | Displays a static title at the top of the page. |
| `Post.tsx` | Displays each post with its title, body, and optional additional content via children. |
| `Button.tsx` | A flexible button that accepts text or any JSX elements as children. |
| `App.tsx` | The main page that connects and displays all components together. |

## 💡 Technical Summary

This project was built using:
- **React 18**
- **Vite** for fast and lightweight setup
- **TypeScript** for safe and structured coding
- **CSS Modules** for simple, scoped component styling

✨ This challenge was a key step in practicing component-based development with TypeScript in a real-world setup! 🚀
